## Use Lambda Functions within a Stateless Architecture on AWS

Your company is using Amazon S3 for file storage (using an S3 bucket) where all users can put and delete their files. When a user uploads or deletes a file, your company requires an entry to be immediately created in the database table. This entry contains the file metadata, like the fileâ€™s name, creation time, size of the file, Bucket, Event, and so on.
